# Week 1 Plan

- Anchor topics come from README.md:13-18: variables & types, lists/dicts, loops/conditionals, file I/O, and two mini-projects (file renamer, log parser).
- **Day 1 – Kickoff Foundations**: Watch the "Python Fundamentals" introduction section (Pluralsight path: *Python Fundamentals* by Austin Bingham & Robert Smallshire) to review variable declarations, numeric/string types, and REPL usage; take quick notes on naming conventions and DevOps-friendly scripting patterns.
- **Day 2 – Collections Focus**: Use the modules "Working with Lists and Tuples" and "Working with Dictionaries and Sets" in the same path to dive into slicing, comprehensions, and mutation. Reinforce by scripting small snippets that read environment metadata (e.g., gather file names, config keys) to align with later automation work.
- **Day 3 – Control Flow Mastery**: Complete the "Control Structures" module, covering branching and looping constructs plus truthy/falsey behavior; immediately solve 3–5 short Pluralsight coding challenges or replicate exercises such as filtering log lines or iterating over command outputs.
- **Day 4 – File I/O Essentials**: Take the "Working with Files and Directories in Python" course (Pluralsight) or the dedicated module within "Python Standard Library – File System Services." Practice reading/writing text and CSV data, handling encodings, and using pathlib—all groundwork for the week’s projects.
- **Day 5 – Mini Project A (File Renamer)**: Apply variables/control flow and file I/O to script a command that bulk-renames files (e.g., normalize log names or append timestamps). Draft requirements, sketch pseudo-code, then implement; document assumptions so it can become a portfolio snippet.
- **Day 6 – Mini Project B (Log Parser)**: Review Pluralsight’s "Working with Data and Files in Python" labs for parsing strategies, then build a parser that scans sample logs, extracts severity, and summarizes counts. Focus on clean functions, loops, and dictionary aggregations.
- **Day 7 – Review & Reflection**: Re-watch any tricky Pluralsight segments, refactor the two projects for readability, and push notes/code to your repo. Capture lessons learned plus a checklist of gaps before entering Week 2 (CLI tooling and error handling).
